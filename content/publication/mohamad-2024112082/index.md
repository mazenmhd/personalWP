abstract: With the increasing prevalence of open and connected products, cybersecurity
  has become a serious issue in safety-critical domains such as the automotive industry.
  As a result, regulatory bodies have become more stringent in their requirements
  for cybersecurity, necessitating security assurance for products developed in these
  domains. In response, companies have implemented new or modified processes to incorporate
  security into their product development lifecycle, resulting in a large amount of
  evidence being created to support claims about the achievement of a certain level
  of security. However, managing evidence is not a trivial task, particularly for
  complex products and systems. This paper presents a qualitative interview study
  conducted in six companies on the maturity of managing security evidence in safety-critical
  organizations. We find that the current maturity of managing security evidence is
  insufficient for the increasing requirements set by certification authorities and
  standardization bodies. Organizations currently fail to identify relevant artifacts
  as security evidence and manage this evidence on an organizational level. One part
  of the reason are educational gaps, the other a lack of processes. The impact of
  AI on the management of security evidence is still an open question.
